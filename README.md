# franktictactoe
I created a game of tic tac toe using a 3x3 board. Player 1's moves are represented with an "X" and player 2's moves are represented with an "O". The game ends when the either player 1 or player 2 gets 3 in a row or the gameboard is filled with moves and the game ends in tie.
The game board looks like this:
     A   B   C
   -------------
0  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
1  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
2  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
 
 
Players enter moves by specifying letter then number in the command line. For example, "A 0" would put a marker("X" or "O") in the top left square:


     A   B   C
   -------------
0  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
1  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
2  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
Player 1's turn: A 0

     A   B   C
   -------------
0  | X |   |   | 
   -------------
1  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
2  |   |   |   | 
   -------------
