# franktictactoe
I created a game of tic tac toe using a 3x3 board. Player 1's moves are represented with an "X" and player 2's moves are represented with an "O". The game ends when the either player 1 or player 2 gets 3 in a row or the gameboard is filled with moves and the game ends in tie.
The game board looks like this:

Players enter moves by specifying letter then number in the command line. For example, "A 0" would put a marker("X" or "O") in the top left square:
